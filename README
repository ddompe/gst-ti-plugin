This is a GStreamer plugin for Texas Instruments SoC platforms using the CodecEngine API.

This plugin is a follow up project developed by RidgeRun to the gst-dmai-plugin available
from http://gstreamer.ti.com, that adds support for the GStreamer 1.0 API and merges the
design concepts from the ddompe branch into a refactored design.

The main difference from previous projects is the use of async CodecEngine API to obtain
performance gains on the elements, and the use of the newer GStreamer APIs.

Currently this projects targets support for the following platforms:
- DM36x
- OMAP35x family (including DM3730)

If you need support for other SoC, contact RidgeRun for support.
